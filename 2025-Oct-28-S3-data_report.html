<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><em>This project analyzes the job market for data analysts by looking at years of experience, programming language, and median salary from 400 job posts. The data are originally scraped from Glassdoor in June 2020. The scraping project and full dataset can be found <a href="https://github.com/picklesueat/data_jobs_data" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</em></p>

<p><strong>Interpretation</strong></p>
<p><em>Among 278 job posts listing minimum years of experience from 0 to 16, salaries are widely dispersed for all minimum-year values — variability within each year is large compared with differences in medians across years. The median-by-year black line is nearly flat. The small Pearson r ≈ -0.015 and Spearman ρ ≈ -0.027 indicate no meaningful linear or monotonic relationship between posted minimum years of experience and median salary. Experience alone does not explain most salary variation in this dataset and is not a strong predictor of salary here; role, skills, seniority level beyond the posted minimum, location, and company factors likely drive pay more.

<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>
<p><em>Jobs that list both R and Python tend to have a higher median salary, but they also show greater variability — some very high-paying listings appear in that group. Overall, the median salaries across all categories are similar to one another, suggesting that perhaps other tools (e.g., SQL, Excel, PowerBI), other job requirements, seniority, role, location, or company size likely confound the relationship.</em></p>

<p><em>Prompting for this assignment to generate graphs and AI-generated intepretation required more iterations than I assumed. Nonetheless, I still saved a lot of time generating codes and graphs, and instead spent that saved time on refining prompts and reviewing outputs.</em></p>
